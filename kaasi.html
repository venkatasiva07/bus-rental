        <h2>Kashi</h2>
        <p>Kashi Vishvanath Temple is one of the most famous Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in
            Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of
            the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shivatemples. The main deity is known by the name Vishvanatha or
            Vishveshvara meaning Ruler of The Universe. Varanasi city is also called Kashi, and hence the temple is
            popularly called Kashi Vishvanath Temple.<br><br>
            Phalgun Shukla Ekadashi is celebrated as Rangabhari Ekadashi, that is, colours. According to tradition,
            before Holi, Baba Vishwanath comes back to Kashi after having a cow in the form of mother Bhagwati. The
            temple complex is echoed by the echo of dozens of Damroos. This tradition has been performed for over 200
            years. On Basant Panchami Baba's Tilak is performed, Shivaratri marriage and Rangbhari Ekadashi marks
            parvati leaving with shiva. These traditions are carried out by the erstwhile Mahant family of the
            temple for over a century.
